            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHo hath a most excellent Wash to Beautifie the Face, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the greatest Quality can testifie: Its Virtue is to take out all manner of <hi>Wrinckles, Freckles, Pimples, Redness, Morphew, Sun-burn, Yellowness,</hi> or any other Accident, caused too often by <hi>Mercurial</hi> Poysonous Washes: It also plumps &amp; softens the Skin, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it smooth and tender as a sucking Child. In a word, the young it keeps always so, and the old it makes appear fair and young even to a Miracle: There is nothing of Paint relating to it, neither hath any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the <hi>Secret</hi> but my self, having, with much difficulty, obtained it of a great Lady at <hi>Paris,</hi> which is now dead, who sold it there to the Queen &amp; Court for above Twenty thousand Pistols in one year. You may have from half a Crown to Five Pounds the Bottle. She can furnish you with all sorts of delicate Pomatums, Whitepots that cannot be compared with, and also an admirable Powder for the Teeth, which makes them as white as Snow, and a Water to wash the Gums, which preserves from all Scorbutical Humours, and cures where it is already come. She has also an admirable Spirit for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which being taken one Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Morning, and another at Night, certainly cures it, tho' the Patient were broke out all in <hi>Bloches,</hi> &amp; never so far gone. Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Remedy against that cruel Distemper called the <hi>Stone,</hi> and <hi>Ʋlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Kidnies,</hi> and a most pleasant Diet-drink, which cures the worst of <hi>Consumptions,</hi> tho' the Patient have been left off by others, in a Month or six Weeks time at farthest. She has also great skill in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sore Eyes, or any cold or hot Rheum, caused by the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> curing the black or white <hi>Cataracts,</hi> tho the Patient have been stark blind. And also a most delicate Oyntment to anoint the Face, so soon as the <hi>Small pox</hi> begins to dry, which certainly prevents all Scars or Pits; as also a most excellent Secret to prevent Hair from falling, causing it to grow where it is wanting in any part of the Head, and can alter any Red or Gray Hair to a most delicate light or dark Brown, which will continue for ever without any soil or smooting. She also shapes the Eye-brows, taking off the uneven Hair, and making them perfectly beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, without any Pain, and makes low Foreheads as high as you please, taking off the Hair so as it shall never come again. You may have in the same House all manner of Cordial Waters, and a most delicate Past to smooth and whiten the Hands, with a curious red Pomatum to plump and colour the Lips, which keeps them all the Winter from chopping, and a Plaister to take of Hair from any part of the Body. She cures also any sort of <hi>Ague,</hi> removing the cause, so that the Patient shall never need to fear a Relapse, but will be more healthful all their Life after; with several other rars Secrets in Physick, not fit here to mention; which if any person desire to be satisfied in, they may speak with her every Day in the VVeek, from 10 in the Morning, till 8 at Night. She has also an excellent Remedy for Barrenness in Women.</p>
